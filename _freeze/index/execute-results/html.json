It also enables policymakers and researchers to track progress toward universal access to basic services, ensuring that no communities are left behind in efforts to improve health and living conditions\n.\nThis project examines plumbing insecurity across U.S. counties using 2022 and 2023 data from the American Community Survey (ACS). We identify counties with the highest levels of plumbing insecurity each year and assess spatial changes over time to highlight areas of significant improvement or decline. Using bar plots, choropleth maps, and spatial clustering techniques (Getis-Ord G), we visualize affected regions and detect geographic “hotspots” and “coldspots” of change. Our findings reveal persistent regional disparities and statistically significant patterns in plumbing access, emphasizing the need for spatially targeted policy interventions.\n.\n<br>\n<b>#ToDo --> discuss results.</b><br>\n<b>#ToDo --> probably cut some categories down to 1 sentence (it's pretty lengthy)</b>\n\n## Question 1: \n<div class=\"scientific-box\">\nTop counties had the highest plumbing insecurity in 2022 and 2023?\n</div>\n### Introduction\n\nWe seek to identify which U.S. counties had the highest levels of plumbing insecurity in 2022 and 2023. By focusing on the percentage of the population without complete indoor plumbing, we can isolate areas of concentrated infrastructure need. This can help prioritize locations for public health and policy intervention.\n\nThis question is compelling because access to complete plumbing is a foundational public health necessity. Highlighting counties with the worst access can also bring attention to overlooked rural or low-income regions where investment in infrastructure may be lagging.\n\n### Approach\n\nTo answer this question, we analyze and compare the top 10 counties with the highest percentages of residents lacking plumbing facilities for each year. We'll use two complementary visualizations:\n\n1. **Bar plots** showing the top 10 counties with the highest plumbing insecurity in 2022 and 2023.\n2. **Faceted choropleth maps** to visualize the spatial distribution of plumbing insecurity for these top counties across both years.\n\nThe bar plot is ideal for ranking and clear comparison, while the choropleth map provides valuable geographic context. Faceting by year will highlight changes or consistencies across the two years. At least one plot will incorporate color mapping to distinguish degrees of insecurity.\n\n### Analysis\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
