    "text": "This week we’re exploring water insecurity data featured in the article Mapping water insecurity in R with tidycensus!\n\nWater insecurity can be influenced by number of social vulnerability indicators—from demographic characteristics to living conditions and socioeconomic status —that vary spatially across the U.S. This blog shows how the tidycensus package for R can be used to access U.S. Census Bureau data, including the American Community Surveys, as featured in the “Unequal Access to Water” data visualization from the USGS Vizlab. It offers reproducible code examples demonstrating use of tidycensus for easy exploration and visualization of social vulnerability indicators in the Western U.S.\n\n\nHow does the lack of complete indoor plumbing compare between the 2023 and 2022 Census data?\nWhat counties have the greatest percent of households lacking plumbing?\nAre there differences in indoor plumbing availability between Western U.S and Eastern U.S counties?\n\nThank you to Niha Pereira for curating this week’s dataset.\n\n\n# Option 1: tidytuesdayR package \n## install.packages(\"tidytuesdayR\")\n\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2025-01-28')\n## OR\ntuesdata &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 4)\n\nwater_insecurity_2022 &lt;- tuesdata$water_insecurity_2022\nwater_insecurity_2023 &lt;- tuesdata$water_insecurity_2023\n\n# Option 2: Read directly from GitHub\n\nwater_insecurity_2022 &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-28/water_insecurity_2022.csv')\nwater_insecurity_2023 &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-01-28/water_insecurity_2023.csv')\n\n# The geometry columns are saved as text with the code to reproduce them.\nwater_insecurity_2022 &lt;- water_insecurity_2022 |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    geometry = purrr::map(geometry, \\(geo) {\n      eval(parse(text = geo))\n    } )\n  )\nwater_insecurity_2023 &lt;- water_insecurity_2023 |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    geometry = purrr::map(geometry, \\(geo) {\n      eval(parse(text = geo))\n    } )\n  )\n\n\n\n\nExplore the data, watching out for interesting relationships. We would like to emphasize that you should not draw conclusions about causation in the data.

As such, our suggestion is to use the data provided to practice your data tidying and plotting techniques, and to consider for yourself what nuances might underlie these relationships.\nCreate a visualization, a model, a shiny app, or some other piece of data-science-related output, using R or another programming language.\nShare your output and the code used to generate it on social media with the #TidyTuesday hashtag.\nSubmit your own dataset!"

The 2022 dataset includes information from 848 counties, while the 2023 dataset includes 854 counties. It should be noted that the disparity in the number of counties is entirely due to increased reporting between 2022 and 2023. Each dataset contains seven variables: geoid, name, geometry, year, total_pop, plumbing, percent_lacking_plumbing. The columns plumbing and percent_lacking_plumbing have a small number of missing values—less than 0.3%—which does not significantly impact the overall analysis."

    "text": "Why we chose this data-set:\nWe chose this dataset because water insecurity is a critical public health issue that may be influenced by various social vulnerability indicators. Water insecurity is a multifaceted issue that encompasses not only access to water but also its quality, affordability, reliability, and infrastructure support. In this project, we focus specifically on plumbing insecurity, which remains a critical and measurable dimension of basic water access. The data, sourced from the American Community Survey (ACS), provides county-level information on indoor plumbing insecurity for both 2022 and 2023. Since it covers multiple counties and spans two years, it is well-suited for analyzing year-over-year trends and regional disparities across the U.S. Improved water security can lead to reduced disease transmission, better hygiene, and overall improvements in quality of life. Additionally, the dataset is clean, complete, well-documented, and ideal for collaborative analysis and visualization."

To represent the available data best, we will be creating bar graphs showing the top 10 counties with the highest percentages of households lacking complete indoor plumbing for each year. The comparison of the plot will be done for each individual year to highlight the most affected regions in the U.S.\nWe will clean the data using dplyr package by filtering and selecting the required variables for the analysis, including name, percent_lacking_plumbing, and year. We will sort the counties in descending order of percent_lacking_plumbing for each year. These subsets will then be combined into a single dataset for visualization.\n\nTo visualize the results, we will create bar graphs and choropleth map to show comparison between 2022 and 2023 using facet separation and explore year-over-year changes in plumbing access. These plots will allow us to address our first research question by identifying the top 10 counties with plumbing insecurity in the U.S between 2022 and 2023 and the counties that experienced any notable shifts in plumbing insecurity between these two years."

    "text": "Approach for question 2\nWe aim to identify and visualize spatial clusters of U.S. counties that experienced significant improvement or worsening in plumbing access between 2022 and 2023. Our goal is to reveal where changes in infrastructure equity are concentrated, rather than occurring randomly across the country. To do this, we will create a color-coded choropleth map representing hotspots (regions of worsening) and coldspots (regions of improvement) in the percentage of households lacking complete plumbing facilities.\nBefore analysis, we will clean and filter the data using the dplyr package to ensure consistency between the two years. Rows with missing percent_lacking_plumbing values will be removed to ensure accurate change calculations. Since the 2023 dataset includes additional counties not present in 2022, we will exclude these newly added counties, as we cannot calculate change for them. Only counties with valid data for both 2022 and 2023 will be retained, and we will compute the difference in percent_lacking_plumbing to measure change.\nTo detect spatial clusters of change, we will use the Getis-Ord G (Local G) statistic via the spdep package. This analysis will classify each county based on whether it is part of a statistically significant cluster of improvement or decline. Counties will be labeled as hotspots (worsening), coldspots (improving), or not significant, depending on the spatial pattern of their change values. Counties will be labeled as:\n\n\nHotspots (worsening)\n\n\nColdspots (improving)\n\n\nNot significant\n\n\n\n\nTo address the question of spatial clustering in plumbing access change (Q2):\n\n\nIn order to strengthen the analysis and fully frame the spatial hotspot mapping, the following hypothesis has been introduced:\n\n\nHypothesis: “Changes in plumbing access over 2022–2023 are spatially clustered, with neighboring counties showing similar directions of change.”\n\n\nNull Hypothesis: “There is no spatial clustering; changes in plumbing access are randomly distributed geographically.”\n\n\nThis hypothesis supports the goal of detecting localized improvements or declines, and justifies the use of spatial statistical techniques (e.g., Local G*) to evaluate clustering significance.\n\n\n\nIn this context, a “significant” spatial cluster refers to a geographic pattern where counties with similar levels of plumbing access change are more spatially concentrated than would be expected by chance:\n\n\n\nHotspots: z ≥ 1.96 → p ≤ 0.05 (upper tail)\n\n\nColdspots: z ≤ -1.96 → p ≤ 0.05 (lower tail)\n\n\nThe results will be visualized using tmap to create a choropleth map, allowing us to identify where in the U.S. plumbing access is improving or deteriorating in a geographically meaningful way.\n\n\nNote: If the analysis of statistically significant changes over the 1-year timeframe for question two does not reveal clear spatial patterns or meaningful differences, the team will consider an alternative approach. This would involve examining the data based on relative percent changes—for example, identifying counties with at least a 10% or 25% increase or decrease in plumbing access. This method may highlight meaningful shifts that are not captured by strict significance testing, providing additional insights into spatial trends."

By focusing on the percentage of the population without complete indoor plumbing, we can isolate areas of concentrated infrastructure need. This can help prioritize locations for public health and policy intervention.\nThis question is compelling because access to complete plumbing is a foundational public health necessity. Highlighting counties with the worst access can also bring attention to overlooked rural or low-income regions where investment in infrastructure may be lagging.\n\n\nApproach\nTo answer this question, we analyze and compare the top 10 counties with the highest percentages of residents lacking plumbing facilities for each year. We’ll use two complementary visualizations:\n\nBar plots showing the top 10 counties with the highest plumbing insecurity in 2022 and 2023.\nFaceted choropleth maps to visualize the spatial distribution of plumbing insecurity for these top counties across both years.\n\nThe bar plot is ideal for ranking and clear comparison, while the choropleth map provides valuable geographic context. Faceting by year will highlight changes or consistencies across the two years. At least one plot will incorporate color mapping to distinguish degrees of insecurity.\n\n\nAnalysis"
